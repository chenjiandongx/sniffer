# sniffer

*A modern alternative network traffic sniffer inspired by [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich)(Rust) and [nethogs](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs)(C++).*

## Introduction

sniffer is designed for network troubleshooting. Without loading any kernel modules, it can be started at any time to analyze the processes or connections causing increases in network traffic. In addition, the GUI of it is responsive, which can fit with terminals of all sizes automatically.

sniffer uses [gopacket](https://github.com/google/gopacket) to sniff the interfaces and record packet info. gopacket wraps the Golang version of `libpacp`, and provides some additional features. One of the projects which inspired the sniffer is `bandwhich`, which has a sophisticated interface and multiple ways to display data, but it does not support BPF filters. Another one is `nethlogs`, which supports BPF filters, but can only view data by process, cannot view data by connections or remote address. sniffer combines the advantages of the two projects with a new Plot mode.

### Connections and Process Matching

On Linux, sniffer refers to the ways where the [ss](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ss.8.html) command uses [netlink socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html) to obtain the connections of the `ESTABLISHED` state, since that approach is way more efficient than reading the `/proc/net/*` files directly. But both need to aggregate and calculate the network traffic of the process by matching the `inode` information under `/proc/${pid}/fd`.

On macOS, the [lsof](https://ss64.com/osx/lsof.html) command is invoked, which relies on capturing the command output to analyze process connections information. And sniffer uses the API provided by [gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) directly on Windows.

## Installation

***sniffer*** manipulates the `libpcap` library to capture user-level packets hence you need to have it installed first.

**Debian/Ubuntu**
```shell
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```

**CentOS/Fedora**
```shell
sudo yum install libpcap libpcap-devel
```

**MacOS**
```shell
brew install libpcap
```

**Windows**

Windows need to have [npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) installed for capturing packets.

after that, install sniffer

```shell
go get github.com/chenjiandongx/sinffer
```

## Usages

```shell
❯ sniffer -h
# A modern alternative network traffic sniffer.

Usage:
  sniffer [flags]

Examples:
  # processes mode for pid 1024,2048 in MB unit
  $ sniffer -p 1024 -p 2048 -m 2 -u MB

  # only capture the TCP protocol packets with lo,eth prefixed devices
  $ sniffer -b tcp -d lo -d eth

Flags:
  -b, --bpf string                   specify string pcap filter with the BPF syntax (default "tcp or udp")
  -d, --devices-prefix stringArray   prefixed devices to monitor (default [en,lo,eth,em,bond])
  -h, --help                         help for sniffer
  -i, --interval int                 interval for refresh rate in seconds (default 1)
  -l, --list                         list all devices name
  -m, --mode int                     view mode of sniffer (0: bytes 1: packets 2: processes)
  -n, --no-dns-resolve               disable the DNS resolution
  -p, --pids ints                    pids to watch in processes mode (default all processes)
  -u, --unit string                  unit of traffic stats in processes mode, optional: B, KB, MB, GB (default "KB")
  -v, --version                      version for sniffer
```
